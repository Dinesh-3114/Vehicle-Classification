🚗 Vehicle Classification System
A deep learning-powered Vehicle Classification System built using ResNet50, fine-tuned on a custom vehicle image dataset. This project demonstrates the practical application of computer vision by enabling real-time vehicle type recognition through a simple Flask web interface.

Whether it's a car, truck, bus, or bike, just upload an image and get an instant, high-confidence prediction. This system showcases the integration of a robust CNN model with an intuitive web application for real-world deployment.
